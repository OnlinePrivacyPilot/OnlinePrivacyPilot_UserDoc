# About OnlinePrivacyPilot

## What is it ?

OnlinePrivacyPilot (OPP) is the result of a project carried out from 2023 by the Cyber Security 
Research Group (CSG) of the Department of Computer Science at the Faculty of Science and Technology, 
UiT Arctic University of Norway.

## The aim of project

The goal was to design an educational software for the users to collect and systematize public 
information that relates to them. By aggregating and collecting relevant data, the software is able 
to create and display to the users their public digital fingerprint. It proposes them some keys for 
its analysis, and helps them to become aware of all the traces that can be found. Finally, like a 
digital companion, it guides the users through the journey of data management and shows the deletion 
procedure for most of their footprints.
